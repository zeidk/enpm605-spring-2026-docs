   Aliasing
      When two or more variable names refer to the same object in memory.
      Modifying the object through one name affects all aliases. Use
      ``.copy()`` or constructor calls to create independent copies.

   AST
   Abstract Syntax Tree
      A tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code
      produced by the parser. Each node represents a construct in the
      language (e.g., assignment, binary operation). Python exposes this
      through the :mod:`ast` module.

   Assignment Operator
      The ``=`` symbol in Python, which binds a name (variable) to an
      object. Unlike in some languages, ``=`` does not copy a value into
      a memory location — it creates a reference from the name to the
      object.

   Behavior Tree
      A tree-structured model for task execution used in robotics and
      game AI. In this course, students build application-level behavior
      trees with the *py_trees* library to coordinate Nav2 navigation
      actions.

   Bytecode
      A low-level, platform-independent set of instructions generated by
      the Python compiler from the AST. Stored in ``.pyc`` files inside
      ``__pycache__/`` for imported modules. Executed by the interpreter
      loop.


.. _glossary-c:

C
=

.. glossary::

   Chained Assignment
      Binding multiple names to the same object in a single statement,
      e.g., ``x = y = 10``. All names reference the identical object.

   Code Smell
      A surface-level indicator in source code that suggests a deeper
      problem. The term was coined by Martin Fowler in *Refactoring:
      Improving the Design of Existing Code*. Linters like Ruff detect
      common code smells automatically.

   Compiled Language
      A language whose source code is translated directly into native
      machine code by a compiler before execution. Examples: C, C++,
      Rust, Go.

   Container
      A lightweight, isolated environment that packages an application
      with its dependencies. In this course, Docker containers ensure
      a consistent development environment across platforms. See also
      :term:`Docker`, :term:`Dev Containers`.

   CPython
      The reference (default) implementation of Python, written in C.
      When you run ``python3``, you are running CPython. It compiles
      source code to :term:`bytecode` and executes it via an evaluation
      loop. CPython 3.14 introduces officially supported free-threaded
      builds (``python3.14t``).

   Cython
      A superset of Python that compiles to C, then to native machine
      code. Used to write high-performance C extensions with
      Python-like syntax.

.. glossary::

   Dev Containers
      A VS Code feature that allows development inside a Docker
      container. The ``ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`` extension
      opens a project folder in a containerized environment with all
      dependencies pre-installed.

   Docker
      A platform for building and running :term:`containers <Container>`.
      Docker Desktop provides a GUI and CLI (``docker``) for managing
      containers on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

   Dynamic Typing
      A type system where the type is associated with the value (object),
      not the variable name. A variable can be rebound to objects of
      different types during execution. Types are checked at runtime.


.. _glossary-e:

E

.. glossary::

   Equality
      Comparison of **values** using the ``==`` operator. Two distinct
      objects can be equal if they contain the same data. Contrast with
      :term:`Identity`.


.. _glossary-f:

F
=

.. glossary::

   Formatter
      A tool that automatically rewrites source code to conform to a
      consistent style (indentation, spacing, line length). Ruff and
      Black are popular Python formatters.


.. _glossary-g:

.. glossary::

   Gazebo Harmonic
      A robotics simulation environment used in this course. Students
      build and test robot behaviors in Gazebo before deploying to
      real hardware.

   GIL
   Global Interpreter Lock
      A mutex in :term:`CPython` that allows only one thread to execute
      Python bytecode at a time. Limits true multi-threaded parallelism
      for CPU-bound tasks. CPython 3.13+ offers experimental
      free-threaded builds without the GIL.

   GraalPy
      A Python implementation running on GraalVM with JIT compilation
      and polyglot interoperability with other languages (Java,
      JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).


.. _glossary-i:

I
=

.. glossary::

   Identity
      The unique integer (memory address) associated with every Python
      object, returned by ``id()``. Two names have the same identity
      only if they reference the exact same object. Tested with the
      ``is`` operator. Contrast with :term:`Equality`.

   Immutable
      An object that cannot be changed after creation. Operations that
      appear to modify an immutable object actually create a new object.
      Examples: ``int``, ``float``, ``str``, ``tuple``, ``bool``,
      ``NoneType``.

   Integer Cache
      A CPython implementation detail where small integers (typically
      ``-5`` through ``256``) are pre-allocated and reused. Two
      variables assigned the same small integer may share the same
      ``id()``. Do not rely on this behavior in production code.

   IntelliSense
      A code-completion and assistance feature in Visual Studio Code
      that provides context-aware suggestions, parameter hints, and
      documentation as you type.

   Interpreted Language
      A language whose source code is compiled to intermediate
      :term:`bytecode` and executed by an interpreter rather than
      directly by the CPU. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are interpreted
      languages.

   IronPython
      A Python implementation that compiles to .NET Intermediate
      Language (IL) and runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
      Provides access to .NET libraries and does not have a
      :term:`GIL`.


.. _glossary-j:

J

.. glossary::

   JIT Compilation
   Just-In-Time Compilation
      A technique where bytecode is compiled to native machine code at
      runtime, typically for frequently executed ("hot") code paths.
      :term:`PyPy` uses JIT compilation to achieve significant speedups
      over :term:`CPython`.

   Jython
      A Python implementation that compiles to Java bytecode and runs on
      the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Provides direct access to Java
      libraries and does not have a :term:`GIL`.


.. _glossary-l:

L
=

.. glossary::

   Lexer
   Tokenizer
      The first stage of the Python execution pipeline. Breaks source
      code into a stream of tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators,
      literals, etc.). Python exposes this through the :mod:`tokenize`
      module.

   Linter
      A static analysis tool that scans source code for potential errors,
      style violations, and :term:`code smells <Code Smell>` without
      executing the code. The name originates from the ``lint`` tool for
      C (1978). See also :term:`Ruff`.


.. _glossary-m:

M

.. glossary::

   MicroPython
      A Python implementation optimized for microcontrollers (ESP32,
      Raspberry Pi Pico) with minimal RAM requirements (~256 KB).

   Multiple Assignment
      Binding several names to several values in a single statement
      using tuple unpacking, e.g.,
      ``name, age, role = "Guido", 64, "BDFL"``.

   Mutable
      An object that can be changed in place after creation. The
      object's ``id()`` remains the same even as its contents change.
      Examples: ``list``, ``dict``, ``set``.


.. _glossary-n:

=

.. glossary::

   Nav2
      The ROS 2 Navigation Stack. Provides autonomous navigation
      capabilities including path planning, obstacle avoidance via
      costmaps, and recovery behaviors. Configured (not written) by
      students; called via action servers from :term:`behavior trees
      <Behavior Tree>`.

   None
      Python's null value — the sole instance of the ``NoneType``
      class. A :term:`singleton` used to represent the absence of a
      value. Always compare with ``is None``, not ``== None``.


.. _glossary-p:

P
=

.. glossary::

   Parser
      The second stage of the Python execution pipeline. Receives
      tokens from the :term:`lexer` and validates them against Python's
      grammar to produce a parse tree, which is then simplified into
      an :term:`AST`.

   PEP 8
      Python Enhancement Proposal 8 — the official style guide for
      Python code. Prescribes ``snake_case`` for variables and
      functions, ``UPPER_CASE`` for constants, and ``PascalCase``
      for classes.

   py_trees
      A Python library for building :term:`behavior trees <Behavior
      Tree>`. Used in the final project to coordinate high-level robot
      tasks (waypoint patrol, event response) by calling Nav2 action
      servers.

   PyPy
      A Python implementation written in RPython that uses :term:`JIT
      compilation` to achieve 4–10× speedups on long-running programs.


.. _glossary-r:

R
=

.. glossary::

   Rebinding
      Reassigning a variable name to a different object. In Python,
      this does not modify the original object — it changes which
      object the name refers to.

   REPL
   Read-Eval-Print Loop
      An interactive programming environment that reads user input,
      evaluates it, prints the result, and loops. Python provides a
      built-in REPL via ``python3`` or the VS Code Native Python REPL.

   Reserved Keyword
      A word with special meaning in Python that cannot be used as a
      variable name (e.g., ``if``, ``class``, ``return``). Python 3
      has 35 reserved keywords. Use ``keyword.iskeyword()`` to check.

   ROS 2
   Robot Operating System 2
      A middleware framework for robotics development. This course uses
      ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco for robot communication, sensor integration,
      and task coordination.

   Ruff
      A fast Python :term:`linter` and :term:`formatter` written in
      Rust. Replaces Flake8, Black, isort, and many plugins. Runs
      10–100× faster than pure-Python alternatives.


.. _glossary-s:

S
=

.. glossary::

   Shallow Copy
      A copy of a container (e.g., ``list.copy()``, ``dict.copy()``)
      that creates a new container object but does not recursively
      copy the objects contained within it. Sufficient when the
      contained objects are immutable.

   Singleton
      An object of which only one instance exists in the entire
      program. ``None``, ``True``, and ``False`` are singletons in
      Python.

   snake_case
      A naming convention where words are separated by underscores and
      all letters are lowercase, e.g., ``student_name``, ``max_speed``.
      Prescribed by :term:`PEP 8` for variable and function names.

   Static Typing
      A type system where the type of every variable is known at
      compile time and cannot change. Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust.
      Contrast with :term:`Dynamic Typing`.


.. _glossary-t:

T
=

.. glossary::

   Token
      The smallest meaningful unit of source code produced by the
      :term:`lexer`. Examples include keywords (``def``), identifiers
      (``my_var``), operators (``+``), and literals (``42``).

   Type Hint
      An optional annotation in Python source code that indicates the
      expected type of a variable, parameter, or return value (e.g.,
      ``def greet(name: str) -> None``). Covered in detail starting in
      L2.

   Ubuntu
      A Linux distribution. This course uses Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble
      Numbat) as the primary operating system.


.. _glossary-v:

.. glossary::

   Variadic Function
      A function that accepts a variable number of arguments. Python's
      built-in ``print()`` is variadic — it accepts any number of
      positional arguments.

   Visual Studio Code
   VS Code
      A lightweight, extensible code editor by Microsoft. The primary
      IDE for this course, used with the Python, Dev Containers, and
      Ruff extensions.

   Workspace
      In VS Code, the root folder opened by the editor. VS Code stores
      workspace-specific settings in ``.vscode/settings.json``. For
      this course: ``~/enpm605/py_ws``.
