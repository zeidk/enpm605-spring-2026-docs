Assignments
====================================================

Overview
--------

Assignments in ENPM605 are programming exercises designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures. They come in two forms: **individual assignments**, where you work alone to demonstrate your understanding of core Python concepts, and **team projects**, where you collaborate with your peers to build larger robotics applications. Each assignment builds a complete Python application that applies core language features to a robotics-related problem. You will practice writing clean, modular, well-documented code while following professional software engineering standards.

Guidelines
----------

- **Individual assignments** must be completed independently. Collaboration and AI tools are not permitted.
- **Team projects** are completed in assigned groups. AI tools are permitted with proper documentation of their use.
- Follow the project structure specified in each assignment. Submissions that do not match the required structure will receive deductions.
- All code must include **type hints**, **Google-style docstrings**, and **inline comments** for non-obvious logic.
- Ensure **Ruff** is enabled in VS Code and that no linting errors or warnings appear in your Python files before submitting.
- Review the **Pre-Submission Checklist** included in each assignment before uploading to Canvas.
- Late submissions are penalized at 10% per calendar day, up to 3 days. Submissions beyond 3 days receive a zero.
- Team projects include **peer reviews**. Your final grade on team deliverables is based on 60% assignment grade and 40% peer review scores.
