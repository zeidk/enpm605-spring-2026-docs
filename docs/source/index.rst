ENPM605 — Python Applications for Robotics
============================================

Course Description
------------------
ENPM605 focuses on leveraging Python programming for robotics
applications, providing students with the skills to design, implement,
and debug Python programs for robotic systems. This course introduces
students to Python as a versatile programming language for automating,
controlling, and analyzing robotic processes. Through hands-on projects
and real-world examples, students will learn to integrate Python-based
tools into various aspects of robotics, including perception and
control.

The course emphasizes the use of Python in robotic software frameworks
such as the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), enabling students to develop
modular and scalable robotic solutions. Students will also explore
advanced topics such as robotic sensor integration, task automation,
behavior trees, and simulation-based development using Gazebo Harmonic.

Key topics covered include:

- Python programming essentials for robotics
- Modern Python tooling: type hints, pytest, uv/poetry for dependency
  management
- Working with ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco including lifecycle nodes
- Simulation environments: Gazebo Harmonic
- Integration of robotic sensors and actuators using Python
- Transforms and coordinate frames with TF2
- Navigation with Nav2 and application-level behavior trees using
  py_trees
- Best practices in Python coding, debugging, and modularity for
  robotic systems

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Write and debug Python scripts for controlling robotic systems.
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 for robot communication and task
  coordination.
- Interface with robotic sensors and actuators using Python libraries.
- Build and configure simulation environments using Gazebo Harmonic.
- Implement application-level behavior trees that coordinate Nav2
  navigation actions.
- Configure and use the Nav2 navigation stack.
- Analyze and visualize robotic performance data.
