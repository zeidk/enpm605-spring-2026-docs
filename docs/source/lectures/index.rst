Overview
--------

The lectures in ENPM605 follow a progressive structure, starting with Python fundamentals and building toward real-world robotics applications using ROS 2. Each lecture introduces new concepts through explanation, live demonstrations, and in-class exercises. Lecture materials, including slides and demo scripts, are available on Canvas and GitHub.

.. tip::

   Review the demo scripts after each lecture and re-run them on your own machine. Experimenting with the code is the fastest way to internalize the concepts.
