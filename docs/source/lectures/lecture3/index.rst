====================================================
L3: Python Fundamentals — Part II
====================================================

Overview
--------

This lecture covers Python's essential data structures and control flow mechanisms: loops with ``for`` and ``while``, the versatile ``range()`` function, and the four fundamental collection types — lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. You will learn iteration patterns, list comprehensions, and how to choose the right data structure for different tasks.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Write loops using ``for`` and ``while`` statements with ``break``, ``continue``, and ``else``.
- Master the ``range()`` function and its memory-efficient properties.
- Understand iterables and distinguish between in-place and out-of-place operations.
- Create, modify, and iterate over lists using methods and comprehensions.
- Work with tuples, understand immutability, and apply tuple unpacking.
- Implement dictionaries for key-value storage and iteration.
- Use sets for unique collection management and mathematical set operations.

Next Steps
----------

- In the next lecture, we will cover Functions:

  - Defining and calling functions
  - Parameters and arguments
  - Return values
  - Scope and namespaces
  - Type hints
  - Docstrings

- Review and experiment with all code snippets and exercises from today's lecture.
- Practice using lists, dictionaries, and loops together.
