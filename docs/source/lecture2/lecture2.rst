====================================================
L2: Python Fundamentals — Part I
====================================================

Overview
--------

This lecture covers the building blocks of Python programming: organizing code into packages and modules, working with operators and Boolean logic, manipulating strings with indexing and slicing, and writing conditional logic with ``if``/``elif``/``else``. Along the way, you will learn Python's indentation rules, numeric type details, and string formatting with f-strings.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between packages and modules and use different import strategies.
- Apply arithmetic, relational, logical, membership, and identity operators.
- Use the Boolean type and truth-testing rules for control flow.
- Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, methods, and f-strings.
- Write conditional logic with ``if``/``elif``/``else`` statements.

- In the next lecture, we will continue with Python Fundamentals — Part II:

  - Lists and list methods.
  - Tuples and unpacking.
  - Dictionaries and sets.
  - Loops (``for``, ``while``).
  - List comprehensions.

- Review and experiment with all code snippets from today's lecture.
